# Post-quantum-report
Report on post-quantum cryptography. Written at LASEC in EPFL in 2018.

Abstract:
As fears of a usable quantum computer being developed have been growing, the field of post-quantum cryptography has flourished to offer alternatives to the asymmetric cryptographic primitives used today. Acknowledging the importance of this task, the NIST has launched a standardization process which has started at the end of 2017, and will represent the deepest scrutiny this field has ever received. As this important period is about to start, this report aims at giving a snapshot of the state of post-quantum cryptography, and a basic understanding of the different ideas used to build post-quantum cryptosystems, of their computational foundations, of the practical imple- mentations that have been developed and of how they can be compared.
